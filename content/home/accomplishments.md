  I led a team of five students to develop a traffic events detection system using Weibo (a Chinese equivalent of Twitter). This system can automatically collect Weibo streams, identify traffic-related contents and extract key conponents of traffic events. 301 champion teams from 104 universities attended this national competition, and only <span style="color:red">**top 2%**</span> of teams can receive the first prize.

  Sponsored by the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of M.O.E. of the P.R. China (20,000 RMB), I led a team of five students to develop a traffic signal system to help blind pedestrians cross the road safely with the help of a smart wristband. Traditional ways of helping blind pedestrians cross the roads are acoustic signals. However, acoustic signals may be interfered by noise in populated areas or the signal from the other direction of a crossroad. We developed a wristband which can transform visual signals of traditional traffic lights into vibration signals to solve such problems.

  **This project received two Chinese patents:**  <br/>
  **Zheng, Z.**, A Smart Wristband for Blind Pedestrians Based on Wireless Communication and RFID, Chinese Patent, Grant No.: ZL201520320914.6  <br/>

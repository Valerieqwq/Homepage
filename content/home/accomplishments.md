  I led a team of five students to develop a traffic sensing and analyzing system using Weibo (a Chinese equivalent of Twitter) data. This system can automatically fetch tweet streams, identify traffic-related contents and extract key conponents of traffic events. 301 champion teams from 104 universities attended this national competition, and only top <span style="color:red">**2%**</span> of teams can receive the first prize.

  Sponsored by the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of M.O.E. of the P.R. China (20,000 RMB), I led a team of five students to develop a traffic signal system to help blind people cross roads safely with the help of a special wristband. Traditional ways of helping blind people cross the roads are sound signals. However, sound signals may be disturbed by noise in populated areas or the signal from the other direction of a crossroad. We developed a wristband which can transform visual signals of traditional traffic lights into vibration signals to solve such problems.

  **This project received two Chinese patents:**  <br/>
  **Zheng, Z.**, A smart wristband for blind people based on wireless communication and RFID, Chinese Patent, Grant No.: ZL201520320914.6  <br/>

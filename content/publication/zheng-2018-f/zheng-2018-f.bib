 abstract = {Social media data, which encapsulate abundant traffic status information, have gradually become an important data source for sensing traffic status. The information recorded by human language contains a large amount of causality analysis and multi-angle descriptions of the traffic condition, acting as a powerful supplement to traditional traffic information collecting methods. Employing Sina Weibo as a main data source, we apply SVM algorithm, CRF algorithm and event extracting model for classification, named entity recognition and events extraction of microblogs. We develop a traffic sensing and visualizing system, which can collect public opinion, situations, scales and even origins of traffic incidents for transportation agency. Furthermore, this system can provide traffic information for the transportation department in the area which lack traffic detectors.},

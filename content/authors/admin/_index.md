I am a Master researcher in TransData Lab at Central South University, China since 2017, supervised by Professor [Pu Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AyNpEX4AAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on urban data analytics. Before joining TransData Lab, I completed my BSc in Transportation with the highest honor at Central South University. During my BSc, I led student teams working on several research projects and received multiple nationwide accomplishments. I currently serve as a reviewer for IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society Conference and  *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems*.

I have always told myself to solve problems discovered from life experience, which I think is the real value of scientific research. I hope one day my research will contribute to the well-being of our community. I also enjoy sharing discussing my research with fellow researchers, so please feel free to get in touch!

Hi! I am ZHENG Zhi-hao (郑治豪) and go by Vincent. I am a 2nd-year Master researcher in Transportation Engineering at Central South University, China since 2017. I work with Professor Pu Wang in data-driven modeling and multi-source data fusion for transportation applications. I am super interested in discovering problems from daily life, as I have always told myself to do so. My dream for research is that one day it can have a great impact on our community.

Also, I enjoy sharing my research with people, so please feel free to get in touch!
